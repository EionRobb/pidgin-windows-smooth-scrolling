# Pidgin Windows Smooth-scrolling

Support windows smooth scrolling (eg with a trackpad) on Pidgin


Up until Gtk 3.4.0, Pidgin will scroll a large distance when you scroll a short distance on the trackpad.  This plugin gives finer control over scrolling speed so that it's possible to use a trackpad without scrolling too fast.
